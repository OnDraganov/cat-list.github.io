Eulearning is a Python package to compute Euler characteristic profiles of multi-parameter filtrations, as well as their Radon and hybrid transforms.
For the input of eulearning, utilities are included for computing multi-parameter filtrations by vectorising simplex trees from the [Gudhi](gudhi.html) library.
