From the repo:

> Eucalc is a C++\ Python library that implements algorithms to efficiently compute topological integral transforms (Euler characteristic transforms, Radon transforms and hybrid transforms) on cubical complexes. It can be used as a header library for C++ users, or can be compiled into a Python module.
